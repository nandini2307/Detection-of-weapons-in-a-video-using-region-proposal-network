Detecting weapons using YOLO V3 algorithm


The violence caused by guns and other weapons is increasing on a daily basis. It has a probability of increasing to alarming rates putting public as well as law enforcement personnel at risk. To control the violence, especially in public areas or crowded areas, detection of the said weapon must be done. Efficient way to detect a weapon is through surveillance cameras. Current surveillance systems require manual supervision and monitoring. Our model detects the weapon from a video and live video alike which is useful for surveillance. We have used the YOLOv3 algorithm for weapon detection in a video. YOLO stands for “You Only Look Once” which implies that the algorithm looks at the image only once and identifies the weapon (or object). The YOLO models are end-to-end deep learning models and are well-liked because of their detection speed and accuracy. YOLO also makes predictions with a single network evaluation unlike systems like R-CNN which require thousands of network evaluations for a single image. This makes YOLO extremely fast, more than 1000x faster than R-CNN and 100x faster than Fast R-CNN. The dataset is trained for classifying various classes of weapons such as Handgun, Knife, Grenades, Axes etc.
